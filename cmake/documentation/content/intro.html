<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a custom CMake setup designed specifically for Skyrim Special Edition SKSE plugin development. The setup provides a streamlined and flexible build environment to help modders and developers quickly configure, build, and maintain their Skyrim SE plugins.</p>
<p>When creating a new project, you can select from three templates to suit your needs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bare:</strong> Includes the essential files and configurations to get you up and running quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Basic:</strong> Adds a console hook and event registration to help you start integrating with Skyrimâ€™s runtime events.</li>
  <li><strong>Menu:</strong> Builds on the Basic template by including an ImGui menu system for in-game user interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>This setup supports selecting different CommonLibSSE forks (<strong>PO3</strong> or <strong>NG</strong>) during project initialization, ensuring compatibility with your target Skyrim version and modding preferences.</p>
