# SkyrimSE-Plugin-Template

This is a custom CMake setup designed specifically for Skyrim Special Edition SKSE plugin development. The setup provides a streamlined and flexible build environment to help modders and developers quickly configure, build, and maintain their Skyrim SE plugins.

When creating a new project, you can select from three templates to suit your needs:

- **Bare:** Includes the essential files and configurations to get you up and running quickly.
- **Basic:** Adds a console hook and event registration to help you start integrating with Skyrimâ€™s runtime events.
- **Menu:** Builds on the Basic template by including an ImGui menu system for in-game user interfaces.

This setup supports selecting different CommonLibSSE forks (**PO3** or **NG**) during project initialization, ensuring compatibility with your target Skyrim version and modding preferences.
